/**
 * Component categories whose examples render inside a same-origin iframe
 * instead of inline in the host document.
 *
 * Why only these four: every DOM mutation forces a style recalculation over
 * the whole document, and the shipped stylesheet carries ~1,200 `:has()`
 * selectors, whose invalidation is not local. A category page like
 * /components/data-grid mounts 30 full grids into ONE document, so a single
 * hover or sort re-evaluates those selectors against a tree of thousands of
 * cells. Giving each example its own document collapses the tree each recalc
 * has to walk from "every example on the page" to "one example". That is an
 * interaction-latency win, not a page-weight win: each frame re-parses the
 * stylesheet and re-evaluates its category bundle in its own realm, so the
 * trade is only worth making where the examples are genuinely heavy.
 *
 * The decision is PER SURFACE, not per category alone. The catalog and the
 * docs mount the same examples under very different pressure: a catalog
 * category page mounts every example in the category into one document, while
 * a docs page mounts a handful. A category can therefore be worth framing on
 * one surface and not the other.
 *
 * cascader is exactly that case. Its examples are a single short trigger row
 * whose panel is closed until pressed, so a catalog card carries almost no
 * static DOM and gains little from its own realm, while the fixed frame height
 * a panel needs would pad every card. The docs still frame it, because a docs
 * page mounts several cascaders plus the surrounding prose and code blocks.
 *
 * sidebar and message-scroller join the catalog list for a reason the first
 * five did not have: CORRECTNESS, not only interaction latency. Both size
 * themselves against a VIEWPORT rather than against their parent box.
 * SidebarProvider renders `flex min-h-svh w-full`, and shadcn's Sidebar
 * branches on `window.innerWidth < 768` and on a `hidden md:block` wrapper the
 * `className` prop never reaches; MessageScroller anchors a scroll position
 * inside a bounded viewport. Inline, both read the HOST document, so a sidebar
 * example would take the desktop branch while sitting in a 705px card, and
 * that branch's container is `fixed inset-y-0 h-svh`, which escapes the card
 * and paints down the left edge of the page. Framed, the example's viewport is
 * its own box and the branch it takes matches the space it has. Neither has a
 * docs page (content/docs/(components) documents ReUI primitives only), so
 * both are catalog-only.
 *
 * KILL SWITCH: empty both arrays. Every surface falls back to the inline
 * preview it used before, with no other code change.

 *
 * IMPORTANT: heights must be measured NARROW, not at the widest surface. A

 * `ComponentPreviewFrame` renders the iframe at this width and scales it down
 * to fit, so the example always takes the branch the page is about, at the
 * cost of rendering at roughly 0.88 in the narrow band. Measuring the WRAPPER

   * and the edge of its own document's viewport. Framed, that document is the
   * iframe, so the frame height is the budget: the list, plus the search
   * header, plus a footer when the example has one, plus the trigger the panel
   * is anchored under, plus the preview's own padding.
   *
   * WHY THIS IS 360 AND NOT THE 520 CATALOG DEFAULT: the floor is applied with
   * `Math.max` AFTER an authored `previewHeight`, so it is a hard clamp on the
   * call site, not just on the fallback. A floor of 520 would silently raise
   * the docs pages' own `previewHeight={364}` back to 520 and make the override
   * a no-op. The floor therefore has to sit below any height the docs intend to
   * ask for, while still being high enough to stop a careless `previewHeight`
   * collapsing the panel to a couple of rows.
   *
   * 360 is the same value filters uses, for the same reason, and is just under

   *
   * Unlike a clipped in-flow example, a cascader panel DEGRADES rather than
   * breaks as the budget shrinks: `--available-height` falls, the list caps
   * lower, and the panel shows fewer rows behind its own scrollbar instead of
   * overflowing. Measured in the 590px docs frame across all six documented
   * examples, panels span 273 to 301px at a 364 frame and every one fits,
   * against 273 to 425px at 520. The binding case is tree mode
   * (c-cascader-18): 425px at 520, 301px at 364. Headroom is thin at that size
   * (panels bottom out around 359 of 364), so a further cut would start eating
