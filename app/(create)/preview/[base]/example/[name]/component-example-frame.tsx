/**
 * Chromeless render target for a single c-* example.
 *
 * NO min-height and NO centering: the example starts at the top and is free
 * to grow to the full frame width, so the frame height the host authored is
 * exactly the example's box. Centering would spend half of an authored height
 * on dead space above the example (and, for the short filters demos, halve the
 * room their popups get to open into). All real spacing belongs to the host
 * surface: the catalog card's FrameContent padding, or the docs `.preview` box.
 *
 * The one exception is `p-1`, and it is load-bearing. EVERY style draws a
 * card's border as `ring-1`, which is a box-shadow painted OUTSIDE the border
 * box (nova's `.cn-card` computes to `border-width: 0` plus a 1px ring), and
 * luma / sera / rhea / vega add a drop shadow on top of that. With the example
 * flush against the frame viewport those land outside the document and are
 * clipped, so the card renders with no border and square corners. Four pixels
 * clears the ring on all eight styles and most of the shadow; it is invisible
 * against the host card's own padding.

      a code block capped at `max-w-2xl`, say - sits in the middle. This
      wrapper was plain `w-full`, so the same example rendered hard against
      the left edge the moment its category was added to the frame allowlist,
      and the two surfaces disagreed for no reason a reader could see.

      Harmless for the full-width examples: a child that is already `w-full`
      fills the row whether or not the parent centres it, so data-grid, gantt
      and event-calendar are unaffected.
