/**
 * reui-lint.shared.mjs
 *
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH for the ReUI design-system lint rules (@shadcn/lint).
 *
 * The same rule vocabulary governs all three authoring surfaces:
 *   - primitives  registry-reui/bases/<base>/reui        (reui.io)
 *   - examples    registry-reui/bases/<base>/components  (reui.io)
 *   - blocks      registry-reui/bases/<base>/blocks      (pro-sandbox)
 *
 * This file lives in reui.io/apps/web and is mirrored into pro-sandbox by
 * pro-sandbox/scripts/sync-reui.mts, and into the public reui-oss repo by
 * scripts/sync-oss.mts. EDIT IT HERE ONLY. A change in either mirrored copy is
 * overwritten by the next `reui:sync` / `oss:sync`.
 *
 * Each repo's reui-lint.config.mjs imports this and adds only what is genuinely
 * local: which paths it authors, and which non-Tailwind classes are legitimate
 * there. Severity overrides are allowed but must carry a reason.
 *
 * SEVERITY PRINCIPLE
 * A rule errors where the tree is already clean, and warns while a real backlog
 * is being drained. Severity tracks the backlog, never the rule's importance.
 * no-restyle is the most important rule for a consumer surface and is still a
 * warning, because the backlog is large.

/**
 * Classes a file declares in its own CSS, rendered through a <style> element.
 *
 * Ambient animation is authored as a CSS string (`.hero9-blink {...}`,
 * `@keyframes ...`). The linter cannot see those declarations, so each one reads
 * as a class Tailwind cannot generate. Deriving the list from source instead of
 * freezing one keeps no-unknown-classes honest: a genuinely misspelled Tailwind
 * class is still an error, and a file that adds a new local animation never has
 * to touch a config.
 *
 * Both string forms are read. Most files hold their CSS in a backtick literal,
 * but some build it from long double-quoted strings, and gating on the presence
 * of "<style" misses files that render the literal some other way. The CSS test
 * stays loose (a brace with a colon, or @keyframes) because a rule body such as
 * "{ --x: 0.82 }" carries no semicolon.
 *
 * Use it only where local CSS is an established pattern. Do NOT reach for it to
 * silence findings on a surface that has none: in reui.io those findings are
 * real typos, and an allowlist would mask them.
