// Phases are flat siblings in one column rather than a container each, so the

//
// A labeled divider takes no role of its own. A separator role draws its name
// from aria-label and treats its contents as presentational, so the phase name
// you can see would be the one thing never announced. Left as plain content it
// reads in document order, right before the steps it introduces.
//
// The rules either side are pseudo elements on the row itself and the label is
// an ordinary flex child between them, so it needs no background plate and
// nothing should be layered over it.
