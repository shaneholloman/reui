Scale is the remaining 7 percent, all contract driven and all known in advance.\n\nThe recommendation is to stop reading this as one number. Starter churn is an activation problem and belongs to onboarding, growth churn is a plan shape problem, and scale churn is a renewal conversation that already has an owner.",
